Oracle/PLSQL: Mod Function

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In Oracle/PLSQL, the mod function returns the remainder of m divided by n.

The syntax for the mod function is:

mod( m, n )

The mod is calculated as:

m - n * floor(m/n)



Note:

The mod function uses the floor function in its formula, whereas the remainder function uses the round function in its formula.

The mod function returns m if n is 0.



Applies To:

Oracle 8i, Oracle 9i, Oracle 10g, Oracle 11g 


For example:

mod(15, 4) would return 3 
mod(15, 0) would return 15 
mod(11.6, 2) would return 1.6 
mod(11.6, 2.1) would return 1.1 
mod(-15, 4) would return -3 
mod(-15, 0) would return -15
